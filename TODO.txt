Features to implement:


-improve error reporting
-make global const checking runtime?
-add automatic ';' insertion if no character like '+', '(' etc is found?
-if auto ';' then also use direct printing of ';' in errors, because some tokens
	wont't have a content


-stack trace -- IN TESTING
-fine tuning modulo for big numbers -- IN TESTING (double is error prone!)

Fixes to do:

-correct pre- and post increment and decrement -- IN TESTING
