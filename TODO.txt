Features to implement:

-NEXT: closures, like in lox/lua
-add destructuring syntaxes for lists (maybe instances)



-make global const checking runtime? => fix compiler "forgetting" consts when importing -- IN TESTING


Discarded:
-add automatic ';' insertion if no character like '+', '(' etc is found?
-if auto ';' then also use direct printing of ';' in errors, because some tokens
	wont't have a content


Fixes to do:

-stack trace -- IN TESTING

-improve error reporting
