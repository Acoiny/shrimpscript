Features to implement:

-move return address into callframes and make instance/functions be at the 'this' place on the stack
-make String/Array/File classes for their functions and vm access them (like in sob)

-closures, like in lox/lua
-add destructuring syntaxes for lists (maybe instances)



-make global const checking runtime? => fix compiler "forgetting" consts when importing -- IN TESTING

-ASI, when illegal token is found, but preceded by line break, or followed by EOF or '}' -- IN TESTING

Discarded:


FIXES TO DO:
-find out if there is a memory leak in the GC

-improve error reporting

-stack trace -- IN TESTING
